# Project-07-Customers_Clustering
*Clustering customers based on their energy consumption*

### Libraries used:

`import pandas as pd`
`import numpy as np`
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
`import seaborn as sns`

`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from yellowbrick.cluster.elbow import kelbow_visualizer`

`import warnings`


the repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
