# Project-07-Customers_Clustering
**Description**: *Clustering customers based on their energy consumption*

### :orange_book: Libraries used:

`import pandas as pd`<br>
`import numpy as np`<br>
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`<br>
`import seaborn as sns`<br>
`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`<br>
`from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`<br>
`from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`<br>
`from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score`<br>
`from yellowbrick.cluster.elbow import kelbow_visualizer`<br>
`import warnings`<br>


### :dart: About:

The goal of this project is to group customers with similar characteristics in the same group. So **first I loaded the dataset household_power_consumption.txt** and then I had to clean some data because of its format and variables types, this process is called **data wrangling**. After that I did the **pre-processing step**, in this step I have to prepare my dataset to the algorithm each is the last step. Finally I used the library **KMeans to group the data, and calculate de Silhouette Score of the models**, in this case the second model is the best one, with **Silhouette Score of 0.56 approximately.**
